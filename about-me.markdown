My name is Jack Amsbry and I am a recent graduate of Tufts University with a BS and MS in Mechanical Engineering. This website serves as a collection of my past projects both for classes and for my own learning. For a more in depth look at the code of the projects, please visit my Github page. Feel free to contact me by email or via LinkedIn. Thanks for visiting!
