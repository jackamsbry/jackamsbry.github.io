The goal of this robot was to find and grab an unknown object. The robot was to be controlled remotely using the SystemLink Cloud. Our robot, Hugbot, is controlled simply via a SystemLink dashboard pictured below. We wanted to minimize communication with the cloud to decrease latency, so we have only one variable that commands the movement of the robot. We additionally, attempted to implement a search algorithm that would find the object so there would be no communication to the cloud.
