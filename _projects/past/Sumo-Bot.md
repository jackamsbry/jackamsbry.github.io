This goal of this first project was to create a robot to push another robot off a table.  The robot has a few main features. The robot had an ultrasonic sensor that scanned in a 120 degree arc that would search for other robots or objects. Once an object is found, the robot turns towards the object. The robot also had a touch sensor on each side of the robot. Once the sensor is pressed, the robot turns towards the pressed sensor.  Once the distance found by the ultrasonic sensor was below 300 mm, the robot turned towards the object or other robot.
