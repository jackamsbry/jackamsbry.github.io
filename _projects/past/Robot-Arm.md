blurb: "This project was built as a final project of a Tufts University robotics class. The class was tasked with moving a ball between two points to be part of one large 'Rube Goldberg' machine. For my module, I wanted to make a robotic arm using the LEGO parts on hand (This was after the school closures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic)."
